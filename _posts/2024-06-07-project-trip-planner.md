## Context
Over the summer break, many of my friends including me would love to travel. I was thinking if AI can help plan my next trip.

I Developed a sophisticated multi-agent AI system application in Python to deliver highly personalized and
seamless trip planning services for customers.

I Automated 80% of trip planning tasks by strategically integrating cutting-edge AI agents, significantly reducing
manual effort and streamlining the overall user experience.

## Metrics
After I have a prototype of the project, how can I measure the success? I did a simple calculation.

tasks can be automated: data collection from various sources, user preferences and options, price comparison, book reservation

tasks cannot be automated: answer users question or handle requests that require human judgement.

this project can handle 80% of trip planning tasks while book reservation is not yet implemented.
