## Content

As a digitial creator and data scientist, I would love to combine the two and assist social media growth. Although this project is a rough idea, I would love to expand
further as I gain more data through my contents..

Leveraged open source Llama 3.1 AI model to generate compelling captions and recommend impactful social media strategies for content creators.

Drove a 5% increase in account impressions through data-driven content optimizations, demonstrating strong analytical and problem-solving skills.|

This is an ongoing project!! I am looking for ideas to keep growing this project!
