Graduating with a degree in Data Science, I decided to pursue my passion for building software. Storing data and deploying ML Apps in Data Science lead me toward software design. As someone who has grit, I read many resources to learn software design. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of solving an ambiguous problem and embrace uncertainty.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading on latest tech advancement(Not feel like job), traveling, photographing and hiking.

With a can do, can reason, can improve mindset at all time.
